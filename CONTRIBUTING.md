# Contributing to Cat and Bot

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Cat and Bot is open-source and shared so anyone can enjoy, remix, and translate it.

---

## How You Can Contribute

- **Translations**: Provide a translation of an episode (using the speech bubble text files).
- **Remixes**: Create new versions, edits, or adaptations.
- **Fan Creations**: Comics, memes, alternate takes — all welcome.

---

## Ways to Share Your Work

- **Pull Request (GitHub)**: If you’re comfortable with Git, you can fork this repo and open a PR to add your translation or remix.
- **Direct Share**: If Git isn’t your thing, no worries! Just send me a link to your work (via Bluesky, Mastodon, Ko-fi, or email), and I may feature it on the Cat and Bot website or newsletter.

## Guidelines

- Keep contributions family-friendly (Cat and Bot is aimed at all-ages).
- Use the included **Crayon Libre** font for consistency.
- Always credit your work appropriately (e.g. “Translation of Cat and Bot by [Your Name], original by Tristen Grant under CC BY-SA 4.0”).

## Note

This project uses a **hybrid open model**:

- You are completely free to remix, adapt, and share under the CC BY-SA license without needing approval.
- If you’d like your contribution to appear in the **official repo or site**, I’ll review it for fit, consistency, and tone.
